    The protobuf frames file is a series of frames (see here:
    https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/techniques#streaming)
    which exist because we need to save multiple frames to a single file.
    Unfortunately, python bindings are not documented/available so we
    need to use the google protobuf internals. The message format is
    "size of message, message".

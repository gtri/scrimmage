AirSimSensor Plugin Setup
=========================

    SCRIMMAGE's AirSimSensor Plugin can be used to generate photo-realistic camera images and
    realistic LIDAR/ IMU data during a multiple drone simulation created using the SCRIMMAGE
    simulation architecture. SCRIMMAGE provides a sensor plugin that communicates over AirSim's
    RPC protocol to set the position and orientation of an entity in AirSim and retrieve
    the camera images, LIDAR and IMU data generated by AirSim. This sensor data can be used
    along with the SCRIMMAGE simulation architecture to design computer vision and navigation
    algorithms for autonomous aerial systems. The ``quad-airsim-ex1.xml`` mission file provides
    an example for configuring SCRIMMAGE to use the AirSimSensor plugin with a SCRIMMAGE entity.
    The SCRIMMAGE ROSAirSim plugin gives an example of publishing image and LIDAR data to ROS
    from SCRIMMAGE messages.

System Setup
------------

In order to run SCRIMMAGE's AirSimSensor Plugin there are 2 setup options: Linux Only
or Linux/Windows setup. Both options require a Linux machine because SCRIMMAGE only
runs on a Linux operating system (Ubuntu 18.04 Recommended). First we will setup
SCRIMMAGE/AirSim on a Linux machine, afterward we will setup Unreal/AirSim on either
the same(or different) Linux machine or on a Windows machine.

Some may find the 2 machine setup, such as Linux/ Windows, useful because two machines
can handle the processing load for larger simulations better than one machine. Furthermore,
you could also achieve the Linux Only setup using 2 Linux machines by installing
SCRIMMAGE/AirSim on one Linux machine and Unreal/AirSim on another Linux machine.
All 2 machine options require the machines are on the same local network.

Again, the Linux Only setup can be achieved using one Linux machine. The Linux/Windows
setup could also be achieved by running a Linux virtual machine on a Windows machine, therefore
only requiring one Windows machine (try at own discretion).

There is no difference in features between the Linux Only or Linux/Windows setups, however
Unreal Engine being originally Windows based may have some gaps in support for Linux.
For more information see AirSim's build_linux.md documentation:
https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/docs/build_linux.md

.. Note:: You will notice we clone and build AirSim twice in this tutorial.
          Unreal Engine uses libc++ while SCRIMMAGE uses libstdc++. You
          cannot easily link binaries that are built from one library with
          binaries that were built with the other library. The simplest way of
          dealing with this issue is to build the AirSim library in two
          different directories.


1. Setup SCRIMMAGE/AirSim on your Linux machine
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ubuntu 18.04 Recommended

#. **Clone SCRIMMAGE and install dependencies**

   Some of the following directions were taken from SCRIMMAGE's README.md documentation, but they are placed here for completeness.

    .. code-block:: bash

      # go to folder where you clone GitHub projects
      git clone https://github.com/gtri/scrimmage.git

      # Install SCRIMMAGE dependencies
      cd scrimmage
      sudo ./setup/install-binaries.sh -e 0 -p 3
      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kevin-demarco/scrimmage
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install scrimmage-dependencies scrimmage-jsbsim
      echo "source ~/.scrimmage/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
      source ~/.scrimmage/setup.bash


#. **Build the libstdc++ version of AirSim (which will be loaded into SCRIMMAGE)**

    .. code-block:: bash

      # go to folder where you clone GitHub projects
      git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim.git AirSim-gcc
      cd AirSim-gcc
      git checkout 9e3aed1b020b46f9fb975b4ab343b06364bdd544
      git apply /path/to/scrimmage/3rd-party/patches/airsim_build_updates.patch
      ./setup.sh --gcc
      ./build.sh --gcc

#. **Build SCRIMMAGE's AirSimSensor Plugin**

   Go to your SCRIMMAGE build directory and provide the location of the AirSim
   libraries (gcc version) to cmake to build:

    .. code-block:: bash

      cd /path/to/scrimmage
      rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build
      cmake .. -DAIRSIM_ROOT_SEARCH=/path/to/AirSim-gcc
      make

   Ensure that the ``AirSimSensor_plugin`` target built successfully.


2. Setup Unreal/AirSim on Linux OR Windows
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. **Make sure you are registered with Epic Games. This is required to get source code access for Unreal engine.**

   Visit https://github.com/EpicGames/Signup for instructions.


#. **Unreal/AirSim Setup (this may take a while!). Note: We only support Unreal Engine 4.24 and newer.**

    .. Note:: Below you will **either** follow the ``Linux Unreal/AirSim Setup`` **or** the ``Windows Unreal/AirSim Setup``, but **not both**. See beginning of System Setup for more details.

       ``Linux Unreal/AirSim Setup``

       Some of the following directions were taken from AirSim's build_linux.md documentation, but they are placed here for completeness.

       ``Windows Unreal/AirSim Setup``

       Some of the following directions were taken from AirSim's build_windows.md documentation, but they are placed here for completeness.

       * **Install Unreal Engine**

        1. [Download](https://www.unrealengine.com/download) the Epic Games Launcher. While the Unreal Engine is open source and free to download, registration is still required.
        2. Run the Epic Games Launcher, open the **Library** tab on the left pane.
        3. Click on the **Add Versions** which should show the option to download **Unreal 4.24**.
        4. If you have multiple versions of Unreal installed then **make sure 4.24 is set to current** by clicking down arrow next to the Launch button for the version.

       * **Build AirSim**

        1. Install Visual Studio 2019.
        **Make sure** to select **Desktop Development with C++** and **Windows 10 SDK 10.0.18362** (should be selected by default) while installing VS 2019.

        2. Start the Windows Program **Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019**.

        .. code-block:: bash

          # Clone the AirSim repo into or close to the *c:/ directory*, else you will receive errors during installation for filenames being too long
          git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim.git

          # Go to the AirSim directory and checkout the same commit used when setting up SCRIMMAGE/AirSim on Linux
          cd AirSim && git checkout 9e3aed1b020b46f9fb975b4ab343b06364bdd544

          # Run build.cmd from the command line. This will create plugin bits in the Unreal\Plugins folder that can be dropped into any Unreal project.
          build.cmd


#. **Open the Blocks Environment in Unreal Engine**

    Go the Linux or Windows machine that you setup Unreal/AirSim. Some of the following directions were taken from
    AirSim's unreal_blocks.md documentation, but they are placed here for completeness.

    **Open Blocks in Linux Unreal Engine**
      Go to the UnrealEngine repository that you cloned and run the UE4Editor binary that was built.

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd /path/to/UnrealEngine
         ./Engine/Binaries/Linux/UE4Editor

      Use the UE4Editor to open the Blocks project (Blocks.uproject) in the
      /path/to/AirSim-plugin/Unreal/Environments/Blocks directory. You will
      probably be prompted about copying the project for updating the project version. Look under "more details" and select
      convert the project "in place."

      When you hit the "Play" button in the project, choose quadcopter, and you should see a quadrotor
      appear on the screen and it may start flying around.

      If you receive an error due to Unreal requiring your GPU to have Vulkan Drivers:
        1. First install the Latest Tested, Proprietary NVIDIA Driver using this tutorial
           https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-linux-install-nvidia-driver-latest-proprietary-driver/
        2. Install Vulcan:

          .. code-block:: bash

             sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
             sudo apt upgrade
             sudo apt install vulkan-utils



    **Open Blocks in Windows Unreal Engine**
      1. Navigate to folder **AirSim\\Unreal\\Environments\\Blocks** and run **update_from_git.bat**.
      2. Double click on generated .sln file to open in Visual Studio 2019.
      3. Make sure **Blocks** project is the startup project, build configuration is set to **DebugGame_Editor** and **Win64**. Hit F5 to run.
      4. Press the Play button in Unreal Editor, choose quadcopter, and you should see a quadrotor appear on the screen and it may start flying around.

3. Run the Default AirSimSensor Simulation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. **Configure AirSim Settings for SCRIMAMGE**

   Unreal/AirSim reads a json file located at ~/Documents/AirSim/settings.json to
   configure itself on the machine where Unreal/AirSim is running. SCRIMMAGE AirSimSensor
   provides an example json file that corresponds with the default AirSimSensor simulation and AirSimSensor.xml
   settings. After running AirSim to open the Blocks environment, it will create an empty json file. Let's remove
   it and copy the one provided by SCRIMMAGE AirSimSensor to the ~/Documents/AirSim/ directory.

   .. code-block:: bash

      ### If Unreal/AirSim is running on Linux:
      rm ~/Documents/AirSim/settings.json
      cd ~/Documents/AirSim
      cp /path/to/scrimmage/include/scrimmage/plugins/sensor/AirSimSensor/settings.json .

      ### If Unreal/AirSim is running on Windows:
      # Replace ~/Documents/AirSim/settings.json with file located here:
      # https://github.com/gtri/scrimmage/blob/master/include/scrimmage/plugins/sensor/AirSimSensor/settings.json

#. **Run the Default SCIMMAGE AirSimSensor Simulation**

   Find the IP of the machine that you are running Unreal/AirSim. If Unreal/AirSim is running on the same Linux machine
   you installed SCRIMMAGE use the Local Host IP (usually 127.0.0.1). Place the Unreal/AirSim IP in the quad-airsim-ex1.xml
   mission file in scrimmage on your Linux machine. Run the mission in scrimmage, watch AirSim connect, and hit 'b' to
   start the simulation.

   .. code-block:: bash

      # Open "quad-airsim-ex1.xml" in /scrimmage/missions directory using your favorite text editor
      nano /path/to/scrimmage/missions/quad-airsim-ex1.xml
      # change "airsim_ip" to your Unreal/AirSim IP
      <sensor airsim_ip="YOUR_IP">AirSimSensor</sensor>
      # Save and run the mission
      scrimmage ./quad-airsim-ex1.xml
      # Should connect successfully
      # hit 'b' key to start simulation
      # You should see 4 image streams appear in separate windows from the scrimmage window.
      # for directions on how to control scrimmage see scrimmage github:
      # (https://github.com/gtri/scrimmage)

4. Setup Photo-Realistic Environments
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

AirSim offers photo-realistic environments that can be played(not edited) for every release version called **"Assets"**.
They can be found here: (https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/releases). Below is a picture of the LandscapeMountains
Environment.

  **Windows Setup**
    If you are running Unreal/AirSim on a Windows machine, download one of the Asset ZIP files under **v1.2.2-Windows** and
    place in the directory: c:/path/to/AirSim/Unreal/Environments/. Assets for newer versions of AirSim will not work with
    older versions of AirSim installed on your Windows machine. Use 7-Zip to extract by selecting "Extract to <ASSET_NAME>\\".
    Inside the folder you will find a <ASSET_NAME>.exe application. Double click the application file to start the
    environment, choose "no" for quadcopter. The environment will start in full-screen. Now start the scrimmage mission
    on your Linux machine using "scrimmage ./missions/quad-airsim-ex1.xml". The scrimmage simulation will connect to
    AirSim and control the car/ quadcopter in the new Asset environment. To end the simulation you will need to enter
    the Task Manager by pressing CTRL+ALT+DELETE, select the Unreal process, and press "End Task".

  **Linux Setup**
    If you are running Unreal/AirSim on a Linux machine, download one of the Asset ZIP files under **v1.3.1-Linux** and
    place in the directory: ~/path/to/AirSim-clang/Unreal/Environments/. Extract the zip file, and run as shown below:

    .. code-block:: bash

      ### Extract and run:
      unzip LandscapeMountains.zip
      ./LandscapeMountains/LandscapeMountains.sh -windowed
      # If the window captures your mouse use ALT+Tab to escape

Configure AirSimSensor Settings
-------------------------------

Vehicle Settings
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    **Multiple Vehicles**
        The default SCRIMMAGE AirSimSensor mission file, quad-airsim-ex1.xml, and the settings.json file given in this tutorial
        are already setup to use 2 quadcopters. You will notice there are 2 ``entity`` tags stated in the quad-airsim-ex1.xml mission
        file. You can add as many Entities/quadcopters as you need, however if you are saving images from each quadcopter you
        will eventually see a lag in the simulation as you add more and more quadcopters. You can add an additional quadcopter
        by adding a new ``entity`` tag with count=1 in the quad-airsim-ex1.xml mission file and adding a new vehicle to the
        Documents/AirSim/settings.json file on the machine running Unreal/AirSim. please use unique, lowercase names for naming each
        vehicle.

        Each new Entity you add must contain a "<sensor>AirSimSensor</sensor>" tag (and if you are using ROS an
        "<autonomy>ROSAirSim</autonomy>" tag). The ``vehicle_name`` variables in the quad-airsim-ex1.xml mission file under the
        "<sensor>AirSimSensor</sensor>" tags **MUST** match both the ``VehicleName`` variables used in the AirSimSensor.xml
        configuration file and the user chosen names of vehicles in the Documents/AirSim/settings.json file on the machine running
        Unreal/AirSim under "Vehicles{}", by default these are "robot1" and "robot2". Failure to use matching names/ settings will
        result in an RPC error.

    **Vehicle Pose**
        To set custom vehicle pose relative to Latitude/Longitude you must specify the vehicle pose in ENU frame coordinates in the
        quad-airsim-ex1.xml mission file and the same vehicle coordinates in NED frame in the settings.json file. For the scrimmage
        and AirSim simulations to match up you must do this conversion correctly.

        To Transform between ENU and NED coordinate frames -> switch x & y, negate z.  A great tool for checking conversions is:
        https://www.andre-gaschler.com/rotationconverter/

            .. Warning:: For vehicles please leave Z=0.0 in the settings.json file or you will experience a simulation viewing error.
               Only set Z, initial altitude, in the quad-airsim-ex1.xml mission file.


Image Settings
+++++++++++++++

    **AirSimSensor.xml**
        Open the configuration file for the AirSimSensor SCRIMMAGE plugin, which is
        located at: /path/to/scrimmage/include/scrimmage/plugins/sensor/AirSimSensor/AirSimSensor.xml.

        .. Warning:: The settings in the AirSimSensor.xml must match the corresponding settings in the Unreal/AirSim
          ~/Documents/AirSim/settings.json file or the SCRIMMAGE simulation and the Unreal/AirSim simulation will not
          match up and you will receive an RPC error on start-up.

        Multiple simulated cameras can be configured through the ``camera_config`` example tag.
        This tag takes a list of camera configurations, where each camera configuration is of the form:

        ``[VehicleName CameraName ImageType Width Height FOV]``

        The following shows example configurations for simulating multiple camera sensors per vehicle:

        .. code-block:: xml

          <camera_config>
            [robot1 front_center Scene 256 144 90]
            [robot1 front_center DepthPlanner 256 144 90]
            [robot1 front_center DepthPerspective 256 144 90]
            [robot1 front_center DepthVis 256 144 90]

            [robot2 front_right DisparityNormalized 256 144 90]
            [robot2 front_left Segmentation 256 144 90]
            [robot2 bottom_center SurfaceNormals 256 144 90]
            [robot2 back_center Infrared 256 144 90]
          </camera_config>

        The ``VehicleName`` corresponds to the user chosen vehicle name set in settings.json file under "Vehicles{}", please
        use unique, lowercase names for naming each vehicle. The ``CameraName`` corresponds to the user chosen camera name set in
        settings.json file under "Cameras{}" for each vehicle, please use unique, lowercase names when naming cameras and sensors.
        Camera Settings, such as camera location on the vehicle body can be changed in the settings.json file on the on the
        machine running Unreal/Airsim located in /Documents/AirSim. Camera pose relative to the vehicle body must be specifed
        in NED frame in the settings.json file. All variables below **MUST** also match settings in the settings.json file.
        The ``ImageType`` is a type defined by AirSim that specifies the type of camera (optical, depth, segmentation, etc.).
        Each Camera can have multiple ImageTypes requested from it, an example of this setup is shown above for robot1.
        The ``Width`` and ``Height`` variables correspond to the pixel dimensions of the images we want to receive in
        scrimmage from AirSim. The ``FOV`` variable corresponds to the camera field of view (integer) in degrees.To learn
        more about the options available in AirSim see: https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/docs/image_apis.md

    **quad-airsim-ex1.xml**
        Open the mission file for the AirSimSensor SCRIMMAGE plugin, which is located at:
        /path/to/scrimmage/missions/quad-airsim-ex1.xml.
        Read the notes under the commented tag ``<-- AirSimSensor Plugin -->``. Set ``get_image_data="true"`` to request
        image data from Unreal/ AirSim. If requesting data from AirSim, set ``save_airsim_data="true"`` to save all images
        requested and a CSV of vehicle quaternion pose values (ENU, World frame) to scrimmage logs (~/.scrimmage/logs)
        on Linux. The ``image_acquisition_period`` determines the number of times image data is requested from AirSim
        per second.


LIDAR Settings
+++++++++++++++

    **AirSimSensor.xml**
        Open the configuration file for the AirSimSensor SCRIMMAGE plugin, which is
        located at: /path/to/scrimmage/include/scrimmage/plugins/sensor/AirSimSensor/AirSimSensor.xml.

        .. Warning:: The settings in the AirSimSensor.xml must match the corresponding settings in the Unreal/AirSim
          ~/Documents/AirSim/settings.json file or the SCRIMMAGE simulation and the Unreal/AirSim simulation will not
          match up and you will receive an RPC error on start-up.

        Multiple simulated LIDARs can be configured under the ``lidar_config`` tag in AirSimSensor.xml.
        This tag takes a list of LIDAR configurations, where each LIDAR configuration is of the form:

        ``[VehicleName LidarName]``

        The following shows example configurations for simulating multiple LIDAR sensors per vehicle:

        .. code-block:: xml

          <lidar_config>
            [robot1 lidar1]
            [robot1 lidar2]

            [robot2 lidar1]
            [robot2 lidar2]
          </lidar_config>

        The ``VehicleName`` corresponds to the user chosen vehicle name set in settings.json file under "Vehicles{}", please
        use unique, lowercase names for naming each vehicle. The ``LidarName`` corresponds to the user chosen LIDAR name set in
        settings.json file under "Sensors{}" for each vehicle, please use unique, lowercase names when naming cameras and sensors.
        LIDAR settings, such as LIDAR location on the vehicle body, can be changed in the settings.json file on the on the
        machine running Unreal/Airsim located in /Documents/AirSim. See (https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/docs/lidar.md) for more details.
        LIDAR pose relative to the vehicle body must be specifed in NED frame in the settings.json file. Lidar variable ``DrawDebugPoints``
        in the settings.json file will show the LIDAR pointcloud in the simulation as seen in the image below, however it will also
        appear in images saved to the local machine so by default it is set to false.

        .. image:: ../images/LIDAR_DrawDebugPoints.png
            :width: 600

    **quad-airsim-ex1.xml**
        Open the mission file for the AirSimSensor SCRIMMAGE plugin, which is located at:
        /path/to/scrimmage/missions/quad-airsim-ex1.xml.
        Read the notes under the commented tag ``<-- AirSimSensor Plugin -->``. Set ``get_lidar_data="true"`` to request
        LIDAR data from Unreal/ AirSim. The ``lidar_acquisition_period`` determines the number of times image data is
        requested from AirSim per second.


IMU Settings
+++++++++++++++

    **AirSimSensor.xml**
        Open the configuration file for the AirSimSensor SCRIMMAGE plugin, which is
        located at: /path/to/scrimmage/include/scrimmage/plugins/sensor/AirSimSensor/AirSimSensor.xml.

        .. Warning:: The settings in the AirSimSensor.xml must match the corresponding settings in the Unreal/AirSim
          ~/Documents/AirSim/settings.json file or the SCRIMMAGE simulation and the Unreal/AirSim simulation will not
          match up and you will receive an RPC error on start-up.

        Multiple simulated IMUs can be configured under the ``imu_config`` tag in AirSimSensor.xml.
        This tag takes a list of IMU configurations, where each IMU configuration is of the form:

        ``[VehicleName ImuName]``

        The following shows example configurations for simulating multiple imu sensors per vehicle:

        .. code-block:: xml

          <imu_config>
            [robot1 imu1]
            [robot1 imu2]

            [robot2 imu1]
            [robot2 imu2]
          </imu_config>

        The ``VehicleName`` corresponds to the user chosen vehicle name set in settings.json file under "Vehicles{}", please
        use unique, lowercase names for naming each vehicle. The ``ImuName`` corresponds to the user chosen IMU name set in
        settings.json file under "Sensors{}" for each vehicle, please use unique, lowercase names when naming cameras and sensors.
        IMU settings, such as IMU location on the vehicle body, can be changed in the settings.json file on the machine running
        Unreal/Airsim located in /Documents/AirSim. See (https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/docs/sensors.md)
        for more details. IMU sensor pose relative to the vehicle body must be specifed in NED frame in the settings.json file.

    **quad-airsim-ex1.xml**
        Open the mission file for the AirSimSensor SCRIMMAGE plugin, which is located at:
        /path/to/scrimmage/missions/quad-airsim-ex1.xml.
        Read the notes under the commented tag ``<-- AirSimSensor Plugin -->``. Set ``get_imu_data="true"`` to request
        IMU data from Unreal/ AirSim. The ``imu_acquisition_period`` determines the number of times imu data is
        requested from AirSim per second.

Publish Data to ROS
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    First ensure that you have ROS installed on your Linux machine running SCRIMMAGE/AirSim. To publish AirSim data to ROS
    you must build scrimmage with -DBUILD_ROS_PLUGINS=ON, example below. Open the mission file for the AirSimSensor
    SCRIMMAGE plugin, which is located at: /path/to/scrimmage/missions/quad-airsim-ex1.xml.

    **ROSAirSim**
        Uncomment the "<autonomy>ROSAirSim</autonomy>" tag in the scrimmage mission file quad-airsim-ex1.xml for each entity.
        Please set the ``vehicle_name`` to te same setting as the vehicle_name in the AirSimSensor tag in the same entity.
        Setting ``show_camera_images="true`` will display images from each camera type in OpenCV windows. By default images
        are shown using the "<autonomy>Straight</autonomy>" tag in quad-airsim-ex1.xml, the ``show_camera_images`` setting
        should only be set to "true" in one plugin tag per entity.

        If you would like to publish sensor data to ROS be sure to have the corresponding ``get_(sensor)_data`` variable set
        to true in the AirSimSensor tag in the same entity in order to receive the data from AirSim. Within the ROSAirSim tag:

        * ``pub_image_data="true"`` publishes images to rostopic "/<VehicleName>/camera/<CameraName>/<ImageType>/raw"
        * ``pub_lidar_data="true"`` publishes LIDAR data to rostopic "/<VehicleName>/<LidarName>"
        * ``pub_imu_data="true"`` publishes IMU data to rostopic "/<VehicleName>/<ImuName>"

        There are also some ROS configuration options. Set ``ros_python="true"`` to specify for ROSAirSim to publish image
        messages that are compatible with the ROS Python API. Setting ``ros_python="false"`` will specify for ROSAirSim to
        publish images using the Image Transports ROS message type which is compatible with other ROS packages such
        as OpenVSLAM's ROS package. Set ``ros_cartographer="true"`` for ROS AirSim to organize
        it's Transform Tree (TF2)
        structure in a way that is compatible with ROS Cartographer.

    **SCRIMMAGE ROS Data Plugins**
        In the quad-airsim-ex1.xml mission file you will also find some SCRIMMAGE internal ROS plugins. These publish
        data generated by SCRIMMAGE to ROS. Unlike the AirSim plugins you can not add multiple of these sensors to an
        entity or specify their position on the vehicle (coming soon).

        * Uncomment ``<sensor>ROSAltimeter</sensor>`` to publish simulated Altimeter data to ROS.
        * Uncomment ``<sensor>ROSCompass</sensor>`` to publish simulated Compass data to ROS.
        * Uncomment ``<sensor>ROSIMUSensor</sensor>`` to publish simulated IMU data to ROS.

    **Build and Run with ROS**
        .. code-block:: bash

          # Go into Scrimmage
          cd /path/to/scrimmage/
          # Delete build directory
          rm -rf build/ && mkdir build/ && cd build/

          # Config CMake to build SCRIMMAGE ROS Plugins
          cmake .. -DAIRSIM_ROOT_SEARCH=/home/nrakoski3/scrimmage/AirSim-gcc/ -DROS_VERSION=melodic -DBUILD_ROS_PLUGINS=ON
          # Build
          make -j7

          # Open a second Terminal window and start ROS
          roscore

          # Run from original Terminal window
          cd .. && scrimmage ./missions/quad-airsim-ex1.xml

          # Press 'b' on your keyboard to unpause the simulation.
          # More about SCRIMMAGE controls here: https://github.com/gtri/scrimmage#gui-commands


    **View in ROS RVIZ**
        .. code-block:: bash

          # Start RVIZ in a third Terminal window to visualize Transform Trees and LIDAR data
          rviz ./scrimmage/include/scrimmage/plugins/autonomy/ROSAirSim/rviz.rviz

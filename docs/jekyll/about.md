Simulating Collaborative Robots in Massive Multi-Agent Game Execution, or
SCRIMMAGE, provides a flexible simulation environment for the experimentation
and testing of novel mobile robotics algorithms. The development of SCRIMMAGE
was inspired by the [Stage](http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/doc/stage-svn/)
robotics simulator. Specifically, Stage's ability to efficiently simulate
multiple robots and its plugin interface for robotic control, motion models,
sensors, and autonomy communication are desirable. However, Stage is inherently
a two-dimensional simulator, which limits its usefulness for aerial robotic
platforms. SCRIMMAGE provides a three-dimensional robotics environment that can
simulate varying levels of sensor and motion model fidelity due to its flexible
plugin interface. This allows a robotics researcher to simulate hundreds of
aircraft with low-fidelity motion models or tens of aircraft with high-fidelity
motion models on a standard consumer laptop. If greater performance is desired,
SCRIMMAGE was designed with parallelization in mind, such that it can execute
on a cluster.

The [Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI)](https://gtri.gatech.edu/)
supports the development of SCRIMMAGE.
